I created this web page to participate in a challenge I saw on SheCodes. 

Since only a single HTML file could be uploaded, I coded the CSS and JS files within the HTML file. It was a great experience to practice the HTML, CSS, and JS I have learned. 

I hosted the webpage using Netlify; here's the link for those who want to see the result : https://musical-paletas-41c815.netlify.app/ 

Thank you and happy coding!
