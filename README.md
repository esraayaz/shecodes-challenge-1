🩷 I created this web page as part of a SheCodes challenge. 

💻 Due to the submission limit (single HTML file), I embedded the CSS and JavaScript directly into the HTML. 

🐣 This project helped me solidify my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills through hands-on practice. 

👩‍💻 Feel free to explore the code!
